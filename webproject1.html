               <p><b><i>About Canada:</i></b></p>
               <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Canada">Over centuries, elements of Aboriginal, French, British and more recent immigrant customs have combined to form a Canadian culture. Canadian culture has also been strongly influenced by its linguistic, geographic and economic neighbour, the United States. Since the conclusion of the Second World War, Canadians have supported multilateralism abroad and socioeconomic development domestically. Canada currently consists of ten provinces and three territories and is governed as a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state.

		 	Just living in a place like this would also give us the opportunity that we need to be with our family and just observe and take in the exquisite beauty of the mountains and land around us. Therefore, if we had a choice, we know we place in life and our dream to be surrounded by mountains, wildlife, and all of the things in nature that we have been taught and just grown to love in our life. </p>

		 Canadians embrace winter and we invite you do the same. When the seasons change and snow starts to fall, a plethora of unique recreation comes to life. Strap on snowshoes and stomp across powdery glades. Hire a dogsled musher to show you the ropes of traditional winter travel. Choose horsepower over dog-power and straddle a snowmobile. Ice skate across a frozen river hand-in-hand with your companion. Tour the luge tracks and ski jumps from two Olympic Winter Games. From the Aurora skies of the north, to the misty west coast, to the frigid Prairies, to the snowy expanses of Ontario and Quebec, to the blustery Atlantic it's time to take advantage of the cold months while they last. Explore the best of winter in Canada.
